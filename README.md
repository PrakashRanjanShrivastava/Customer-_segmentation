## ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project segments customers based on marketing campaign data using K-Means clustering, aiming to identify strategic groups for targeted marketing and product development.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
- Name: `marketing_campaign1.csv`
- Features include demographic details, product spend, campaign acceptance, and response rates.

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Used
- **KNN Imputation** for missing values (Income)
- **Feature Engineering**: Age, Total_Amount_Spent
- **Data Visualization**: Age distribution
- **Clustering**: (KMeans )

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- Majority of spending is concentrated among customers aged **30â€“50**.
- Income and product categories (esp. **Wines**, **Meats**) are strong indicators of customer segment.
- Potential to identify **3â€“5 key customer personas** for targeted marketing.

## âœ… Recommendations
- Market high-end products to younger, higher-income clusters.
- Revamp engagement for low-response or inactive clusters.
- Use segmentation results for campaign personalization and retention strategies.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
-  Can Add PCA + clustering visualization
-  Can Explore DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering
-  Can Implement RFM-based segmentation

## ðŸ“Š Tools
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
